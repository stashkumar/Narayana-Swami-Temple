      <p>Some clarifications about Srilasree Narayanalandha Swamigal, located at the foot of Sanjeevimalai, Rajapalayam Taluk, Virudunagar District.</p>

      <p>The venerable Srilasree Narayanalandha Swamigal, a member of the Kovilur Adinam, was born in Rajapalayam and at a young age joined the Kovilur Math and took up asceticism. There, he formally studied Vedanta from the Nanajivavadham order to Gnanavasishtha. After that, he learned the Vedanta Shastras from Swami Santanananda Swami, Thiruingoymalai Advaitananda Swami, and Sivananda Saraswati Swami of Rishikesh and attained Brahmanism.</p>

      <p>After returning from there, he stayed for some time at the Brahmananda Swamigal Monastery in Madurai and the Udgalinga Swamigal Monastery in Sikalpauravaithassery, teaching Vedanta to many disciples. The Swamigal was also very learned in Sanskrit and was highly respected by the Thakarathars. He made many Nagarathars his disciples. Later, he attained Videha Kaivalyam at the foot of Sanjeevimala in Rajapalayam.</p>

      <p>The land required for the Samadhi of Mayuranath Swamigal was donated by the then President of the Petthavanallur Thirukovil Devasthanam, Shri K.8, Pattapirama Raja.</p>

      <p>The temple was built in 1982 with the help of the former Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, Amarar Ayyachami Raja, after installing a Shivalinga there and performing the Kumbabhisekam by the Yoginis of Thiruengoymalai.</p>
